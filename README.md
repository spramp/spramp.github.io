Currently, I am the Operations, New Media, and Curatorial Director for the [Center of Art and Thought (CA+T)](http://www.centerforartandthought.org), a nonprofit that facilitates the convergences of scholars, artists, writers, and the broader public by harnessing the power of new media and digital technologies and with the Filipino global diaspora as the organization’s point of departure. I manage everyday operations of the organization and CMS workflow and functionality; curate virtual and offline multidisciplinary and multiplatform exhibitions; research new media projects and implement solutions; generate relationships with artists, writers, and scholars; and manage publicity, fundraising, design and communications projects.

* As a scholar, my research interests include: Asian American Visual Culture, Art History,  and Criticism; Asian American and Filipino American Cultural and Historical Studies; Modern and Contemporary Art; History of Visual and Media Technologies (Photography, Film, New Media , and Digital Technologies); Queer Visual Culture and Queer Theory; and U.S. Cultural History: 1865 – Present (Race, Gender, Sexuality, and U.S. Empire).

<p style="text-align: left;">As a multidisciplinary artist, I  use everyday or vernacular new media and digital imaging technologies to create artwork that captures my interests in queer bodies, affects, spaces, and temporalities. I am attracted to vernacular digital image-making, and I primarily use digital cameras, related equipment, and computer and smart phone applications that are at my immediate disposal (usually not professional grade or expensive).  In my most recent digital photographic <em>iPhonography</em> series (from January 2013 &#8211; May 2013), the series brings to light normative viewing strategies through what I call “tactical juxtapositions.&#8221; I used only my iPhone 4s camera and various iPhone apps to create images that question “the contemporariness” of contemporary photographic practices and technologies. The <em>iPhonography</em> series argues for a more robust, historical, and dialogic understanding of everyday image making.</p>
