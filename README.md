Currently, I am the Operations, New Media, and Curatorial Director for the [Center of Art and Thought (CA+T)](http://www.centerforartandthought.org), a nonprofit that facilitates the convergences of scholars, artists, writers, and the broader public by harnessing the power of new media and digital technologies and with the Filipino global diaspora as the organizationâ€™s point of departure. I manage everyday operations of the organization and CMS workflow and functionality; curate virtual and offline multidisciplinary and multiplatform exhibitions; research new media projects and implement solutions; generate relationships with artists, writers, and scholars; and manage publicity, fundraising, design and communications projects.
